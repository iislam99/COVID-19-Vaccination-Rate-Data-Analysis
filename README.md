# COVID-19 Vaccination Rate Data Analysis

This is a project from my Data Science course in which my partner and I studied the impact of a country's GDP and demographics on COVID-19 vaccination rates.

The excel data files were provided to us and we were required to tidy the data in each excel sheet and combine them into one table to perform our analysis. See the project report for more details.

All analysis was performed using the R programming language.
